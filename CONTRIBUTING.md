# Contributing to this project

Greetings! We are grateful for your interest in joining the Kagenti community and making a positive impact. Whether you're raising issues, enhancing documentation, fixing bugs, or developing new features, your contributions are essential to our success.

To get started, kindly read through this document and familiarize yourself with our code of conduct. 

We can't wait to collaborate with you!

## Issues

Please feel free to report an issue for bugs, and any other problems you
encounter with the MCP Gateway project.

If you have something to propose (e.g. a big new feature) we recommend
starting that out as a [discussion] first, to talk it through and build
consensus ahead of time.

### Process

We have some light process around issue management that contributors should
be aware of: We organize via [GitHub milestones], which are collected into
a roadmap. We use [GitHub project boards] to track the milestones and issues.
Milestones are sequential.

We provide some labels to indicate individual issue priorities based on
impact and time-sensitivity:

* `priority/low` - Low-impact and little time-sensitivity. Can be worked on
  after other issues have been accounted for.
* `priority/normal` - Standard, default priority for issues. Can be worked on
  after higher priority items are finished, and before any low priority items.
* `priority/high` - High-impact, may affect many other issues, and may be very
  time-sensitive. Should accounted for before non-critical issues.
* `priority/critical` - Indicates an extremely time-sensitive and/or extremely
  high impact critical issues. Interrupts other work until it is accounted for,
  and should be used sparingly.
